## Executive Summary

The first objective of this project was to predict housing prices as accurately as possible. Using ridge regression, we are able to explain 93% of the variance in the target variable SalePrice and can predict prices within a 95% confidence interval of +- 30k$.

The second objective of this project was to identify the most influential variables for housing prices. Using lasso regression, we can show that 9 variables explain roughly 80% of the variance. All 8 variables are derived from housing-specific data from the main dataset (as opposed to contextual data), which leads to the conclusion that the latter has only marginal explanatory value.
